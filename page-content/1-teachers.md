<p>
My name is Najia Li ,from Beijing China. I speak mandarin Chinese and am fluent in Chinese pinyin. I have been teaching Chinese at three different Chinese schools in the U.S.A. My teaching methods are very flexible. My students enjoy the way I expand their interest in learning Chinese. I have a love for music, and enjoy playing and teaching the drums and YangQin, which is a special Chinese instrument that has 144 strings. I also am a tournament ping pong player, so I can coach students in the Chinese way of ping pong. I want to have a good relationship with my all students, I can help them to be a useful talent and have a colorful life.
